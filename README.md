# Forex-Adaptive Pricing Strategy for Mercedes-Benz India

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the business impact of Euro–INR currency volatility on Mercedes-Benz India’s vehicle pricing, sales performance, and revenue outcomes. The objective is to support strategic pricing decisions that balance rising cost pressures with customer retention in a competitive luxury automobile market.

The analysis focuses on CKD (locally assembled) and CBU (fully imported) models and evaluates how exchange rate movements influence pricing decisions and demand behavior.

## Business Problem

Sustained volatility in the Euro–INR exchange rate has increased import and production costs for Mercedes-Benz India. Price increases driven by currency movements raise the risk of customer churn to competitors such as BMW and Audi. Leadership requires data-driven insights to determine optimal pricing strategies without significantly impacting sales volumes.
